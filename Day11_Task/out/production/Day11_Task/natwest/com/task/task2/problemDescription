1. Define a class named Fruit Juice with the following description:
Instance variables / data members : int product_code — stores the product
code number
String flavour — stores the flavour of the juice (E.g. orange, apple, etc.)
String pack_type — stores the type of packaging (E.g. tetra-pack, PET
bottle, etc.) int pack_size — stores package size (E.g. 200 ml, 400 ml,
etc.) float product_price — stores the price of the product
Member methods :
(i) FruitJuice() — Default constructor to initialize data members to their
respective defaults.
(ii) FruitJuice(int product_code, String flavour, String pack_type, int
pack_size, float product_price) - Parameterized constructor

(iii)void input( ) — To input and store the product code, flavour, pack type,
pack size and product price.

(iv)void discount( ) — To reduce the product price by 10%.

(v)void display() — To display the product code, flavour, pack type, pack
size and product price.

2. Design a class to overload a function polygon() as follows
(i) void polygon(int n, char ch) — with one integer argument and one
character type argument that draws a filled square of side n using the
character stored in ch.

(ii) void polygon(int x, int y) — with two integer arguments that draws a filled
rectangle of length x and breadth y, using the symbol ‘@’.
